# Learning-Data-Science
Find out resources, tools, and most importantly the steps you will have to take to kickstart your data science journey. This resource is primarily made for this interested in data science for data analysis

**Note**: _This repo documents resources that can help you better understand data science particularly for data analytics. It contains my experience as a participant of the [atomcamp's](https://www.atomcamp.com/dsbootcamp/) data science bootcamp and from the open world of the internet_

## Data Life Cycle ##
Working with data can be messy and complicated so in order to avoid any "foreseen" issues, it's important to pursue data with a systems/structural approach. This is where the term Data Life Cycle Life comes in. As the name denotes, it provides a framework to illustrate how data flows from one step to another, and depending the task at hand, which step you could initiate your work from.

Depending on your niche, and the kind of project you're working on, the Data Life Cycle can have 6 to 8 steps.

1. Data Generation
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning & Processing
4. Data Analysis
5. Data Visualization & Interpretation
6. Data Storage
7. Data Management
8. Data Destruction

The 2 extra steps are Data Generation and Data Destruction (the beginning and the end, quite literally) which th rest of the 6 are sandwiched in. Here we're going to leave the bread and focus on the 6 layers inside.
